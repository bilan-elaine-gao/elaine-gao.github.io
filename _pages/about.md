I am a research assistant in Intelligent Information Processing Lab[(IIPL)](https://sites.google.com/view/iiplcau/home) under supervison of Professor [YoungBin Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=If6P518AAAAJ&hl=ko) at Chung-Ang University. Currently, I am looking for PhD supervisor in Causality for the year 2024 or 2025. [My CV](CV-231110.pdf)


Research Interests
======
My passion for research has always revolved around representation learning. In pursuit of a more human-like feature learning model, I aspire to dive deeper into understanding and harnessing causal relationships to create more robust and insightful deep learning model. Under this mission, my current research interests are as follows:

- Learning to learn causal relation: How to learn causal relations among various data under distribution shifts?
- Model-Agnostic causal representation learning: How to design a generic learning algorthim for robust causal representation learning? 
- Continual causal representation learning: How to continuously learn causal relations?
